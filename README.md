## Overview

### The Challenge

The goal of this project was to create a responsive section that displays four feature cards with different content. The cards needed to be visually appealing, consistent across various screen sizes, and easy to integrate into larger layouts.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** - for the structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS3** - for styling the components, including Flexbox for layout.
- **Mobile-first workflow** - ensuring the design works on smaller screens before scaling up.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The feature cards adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Modern CSS Techniques**: Utilizes Flexbox for easy alignment and spacing of the cards.
- **Clean Layout**: Focused on a minimalistic design that’s easy to read and visually appealing.

### What I Learned

- **Responsive Web Design**: I gained experience in creating layouts that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes using Flexbox.
- **CSS Best Practices**: Improved my understanding of organizing and structuring CSS for better maintainability.
- **Component-Based Design**: Learned how to break down the UI into reusable components, which can be easily integrated into other projects.

### Challenges Faced

- **Layout Issues**: Initially faced challenges with aligning the cards correctly in different screen sizes, which I overcame by experimenting with Flexbox properties.
- **Styling Consistency**: Ensuring that the design remained consistent across different browsers and devices required testing and adjustments.

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to:

- **Add Interactivity**: Implement basic hover effects and animations to enhance user engagement.
- **Refactor Code**: Further clean up the codebase by adopting CSS methodologies like BEM for better scalability.
- **Dark Mode**: Explore adding a dark mode feature to make the section more user-friendly in different lighting conditions.

### Useful Resources
